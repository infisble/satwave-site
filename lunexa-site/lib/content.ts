# Making Waste Visible: Satellite Monitoring for Cleaner Cities

Every city struggles with hidden or fast-growing dumpsites. Traditional field inspections can only cover a tiny portion of the territory each week, which means waste piles quietly expand in industrial outskirts, riverbanks, or abandoned lots.

## Satellites Change the Equation

Sentinel-2 and commercial constellations capture multi-spectral imagery every few days. When combined with machine learning, we can detect the subtle spectral signatures that indicate fresh debris, soil disruption, or suspicious trucks entering the same field repeatedly.

- **Temporal change detection** highlights areas whose reflectance has shifted drastically.
- **Moisture analysis** spots organic waste versus inert materials.
- **Thermal cues** reveal active burning.

## From Pixel to Action

Detection alone is not enough. SatWave automatically creates tasks for municipal crews, attaches before imagery, and requests ground validation through citizen apps or partner drones. Once verified, the site enters the cleanup queue with routing recommendations.

## Transparency Residents Can See

Public dashboards show when each site was discovered, who reported it, and when it was cleaned. Trust is built when residents see the lifecycle from detection to remediation in the open.

# Computer Vision for Recyclers: Turning Photos into Feedstock Forecasts

Walk into any material recovery facility and you'll find a whiteboard full of guesses: How much HDPE is arriving this week? Is the next municipal tender full of mixed metals again? Uncertainty kills margins.

## Training Models on Real Waste

SatWave's dataset blends labeled drone shots, bin cameras, and citizen uploads. YOLOv8 handles object detection, while U-Net maps coverage ratios for each material. Detectron2 segments e-waste components so recyclers know whether copper, aluminum, or plastics dominate.

## Confidence Drives Decisions

Each batch receives:

- **Material composition** with percentage breakdowns
- **Contamination risk** scored from 0–100
- **Suggested processing lines** based on facility capabilities

With that information, recyclers can price jobs accurately, allocate staff, and even resell excess materials upstream.

## Beyond Photos

Sensor data (weight, moisture, temperature) augments vision models to flag hazardous waste or organics that require special handling.

# Citizen Ecosystems that Power Circular Cities

Cities that invite residents into the clean-up mission consistently outperform those that rely on inspectors alone. SatWave helps municipalities activate communities with tools that respect time and provide credit.

## Simple Reporting, Rich Context

Residents snap a photo, add a short note, and the app automatically attaches GPS plus satellite context. Reports go through a lightweight moderation flow and, once approved, upgrade the AI models with fresh ground truth.

## Gamification that Matters

Leaderboards showcase "waste heroes," neighborhoods compete on cleanup streaks, and tangible rewards (public recognition, transit credits) keep participation lively.

## Closing the Loop

The most important step: telling citizens what happened next. When a report leads to a cleanup or recycler pickup, the reporter gets images, tonnage, and CO2 avoided. That loop turns occasional reporters into long-term partners.

# Impact Reporting Without the Spreadsheet Chaos

Waste departments juggle spreadsheets from contractors, recyclers, and IoT vendors. By the time quarterly ESG or CSRD disclosures are due, nobody trusts the numbers.

## A Single Source of Truth

SatWave logs every site, cleanup, and transported batch with immutable metadata: who, when, material type, tonnage, destination, and verified imagery. That record feeds dashboards and exports formatted for regulators.

## Metrics That Matter

- Tons diverted from landfill
- CO2 equivalent saved
- Percent of waste monetized
- Response time per incident

## Audit-Ready in Clicks

Because every data point carries provenance, auditors and citizens alike can dig into the chain of events. Transparency stops being painful and becomes a differentiator for forward-looking cities.
